\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 I am looking to do the Datadog fundamentals exam. Create test questions to be able to practice based on the two docs attached. Provide the answers at the end of your output. Answers should not appear immediately after the question, but rather at the very end, after all questions. Your questions should be divided into 8 Topics, "Datadog Core Concepts", "Agent Installation & Configuration" , "Metrics & DogStatsD", "Monitoring & Alerts", " Logs & Log Management", "Networking", "API & Authentication" and "Dashboards". You should provide 4 questions per topic.}
